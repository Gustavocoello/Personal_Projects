## Overview 🚀

Welcome to my personal projects repository! This repository is a collection of various projects that I have worked on as part of my learning journey in the fields of databases, Python programming, and machine learning. Each folder represents a different area of study and contains multiple projects and exercises.


## 🗂 Repository Structure
